### Prerequisites
- Fully-privileged access to an OCI Tenancy (account).
- (CLI Terraform deployment only) Terraform set up on your local machine. You can access the steps [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/terraformgetstarted.htm).
- Sufficient availability of resources in your OCI Tenancy. You can check resource availability [here](https://cloud.oracle.com/limits?region=home).


### Deployment via Resource Manager


1. Click [![Deploy to Oracle Cloud](https://oci-resourcemanager-plugin.plugins.oci.oraclecloud.com/latest/deploy-to-oracle-cloud.svg)](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?region=home&zipUrl=https://github.com/scacela/oci-streaming-pipeline-2s/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip)
2. Follow the steps outlined in [this documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/Tasks/deploybutton.htm#ariaid-title4), starting from Step 2.

### Deployment via CLI Terraform


1. [Download this project](https://github.com/scacela/oci-streaming-pipeline-2s/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip) to your local machine.
2. [Set up CLI Terraform on your local machine.](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/terraformgetstarted.htm) 
3. Navigate to project folder on your local machine via CLI.
<pre>
cd &ltYOUR_PATH_TO_THIS_PROJECT&gt
</pre>
4. Open your local copy of [vars.tf](./vars.tf) and edit the values that are assigned to the objects of type variable, which will influence the stack topology according to your preferences.
5. Initialize your Terraform project, downloading necessary packages for the deployment.
<pre>
terraform init
</pre>
6. View the plan of the Terraform deployment, and confirm that the changes described in the plan reflect the changes you wish to make in your OCI environment.
<pre>
terraform plan
</pre>
7. Apply the changes described in the plan, and answer <b>yes</b> when prompted for confirmation.
<pre>
terraform apply
</pre>
8. You can track the logs associated with the job by monitoring the output on the CLI. After the deployment has finished, review the output information at the bottom of the logs for instructions on how to access the nodes in the topology.
